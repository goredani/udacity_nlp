# Evaluate a News Article with Natural Language project

This is my project for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program, Build Tools and Single Page Web. 

The goal of this project is to give the student practice with Webpack, Sass styles, Webpack loaders and plugins and service workers.

In order to develop the project we are using the concept of Natural language processing. I used the MeaningCloud API to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.
